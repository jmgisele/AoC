# My Solns to AoC (2021)
Advent of Code website [here](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm intending on just getting as far as I can since this is year one for me. Solns in Python.

Update 02/12/22: Coming back to AoC to learn a couple new languages as well as sharpen my problem solving skills. Hopefully cleaning up the Python solns and adding Typescript and Java.
